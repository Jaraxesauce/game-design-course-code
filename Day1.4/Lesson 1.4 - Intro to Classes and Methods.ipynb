A method is a block of code you can run, but only when you need it. Up until now, we've been writing linear code, where operations execute from top to bottom. This is not how most code is written, because there are certain things you want to do only at specific times. You can think of these as tiny programs themselves. They are called *Methods* while inside a class, and *Functions* while they are not.\n",

So, let's create a method, called `discover()` for when the player first happens upon the Temple.
